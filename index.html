I am a PhD student at the Economics Department at Stanford University. 

I use experimental and quasi-experimental designs to answer questions in the fields of educational policy and development economics. Before, I worked for two years at J-PAL LAC. I hold a BA and MA in Economics from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.
